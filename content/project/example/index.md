This project was done in the Vertellus Information Technology department at their Tibbs facility in Indianapolis, Indiana. For this project Lenovo shipped our facility 200 computers to be deployed to users that need to be upgraded to new machines. The scope of this company was everyone from the Engineers to the C level employees.

Lenovo worked with our team to create a Cloud Deploy image so that we could easily deploy our image to the brand new Lenovo machines. This was an interesting process to learn, but there were limitations that we faced as some of our proprietary and specialty lab software could not be packaged in the Lenovo image. Overall it certainly sped up the process and I believe it could be a valuable tool for any company that is using Lenovo as a vendor.

After the image was loaded on the new machine, each user had to be contacted and all their files and folders had to be transferred to new computers. Each of the laptops was categorized and added to our domain with the correct group policy for each user. All the laptops were also documented and stored in a database with their serial numbers and the user of that machine. There were some laptops that needed to be fixed by Lenovo because of faulty system board. After that obstacle was overcome, all the laptops were deployed successfully and the project was completed in November of 2020.
